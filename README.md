# Quizell_QuizManagementsystem
The ‘Quiz Management System’ is the project which aims for managing the quizzes and tests on android application which also calculate the results/score and provide to the user as it end. The quiz and test details will remain on the account of the user. In this we provide a extra feature in which any teacher/professor can provides their quiz to their student and analyze the students marks with their account. The quiz and test format was designed by the app own. Teachers and professors needs only to create their account and provide questions and answers in it and the whole design of quiz and test were automatically made.
